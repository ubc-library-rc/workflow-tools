<p>What are your project priorities?</p>

<p>A lot of project and workflow management tools can be used in many different ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are visual elements important for you?</li>
  <li>Do you prefer lots of text?</li>
  <li>Is your calendar elsewhere and do you want to be able to connect it to whatever you end up using?</li>
  <li>How much duplication of effort (if any) is okay?</li>
</ul>

<p>External collaborators</p>

<p>Are you working with students? Individuals in other countries?</p>

<p>Things to consider</p>

<h2 id="your-needs">Your needs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Are you requiring your students to use this? Disclaimer needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="import-and-export-functions">Import and Export functions</h2>

<p>Once your information is in a tool, can you get it out? If not, does that matter much?</p>

<h2 id="longevity-of-the-tool">Longevity of the tool</h2>

<p>There is nothing worse than developing a workflow, learning to rely on it, and then having it pull out from under your feet because a company has shut down.</p>

<p>Does UBC support your tool? Are there other ways to get support?</p>
