### What is this workshop not about?

While this workshop focuses on digital tools there are some great partner tools you might want to look into as well such as the "<a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet journal</a>" or the "<a href="http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/08/starting-up-and-maintaining-an-everything-notebook/">Everything notebook</a>". We also won't go into project management methodologies or citation management tools.

For support with project and citation management consider booking a consult or attending one of our other workshops.
