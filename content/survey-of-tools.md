# Survey of tools

View slides here

Jump to a tool:
* OSF
* Asana
* Trello
* JIRA
* Teams
* Slack
* Git
* GitHub
* GitLab
* OneDrive
* Box

One major consideration is whether a tool is hosted in Canada. This information is usually found in terms of service under a section that explicitly addresses "storage" or "data privacy". Make sure you are aware of the risks.

If a tool keeps data on US servers and does not have Canadian hosting options, do not share sensitive information using the tool.
* [This is what personally identifiable information is](https://isit.arts.ubc.ca/personally-identifiable-information).
* Always follow these guidelines from University Counsel.

The below list is by no means comprehensive and is meant to introduce you to a few tools that may be useful for your work.

## General workflow tools

<hr>
[OSF](https://osf.openscience.ubc.ca/)

<img src="images/osf-logo.png" alt="OSF logo" width="100px" height="auto">

  * The OSF is a powerful and flexible interdisciplinary workflow management tool.
  * UBC has OSF for institutions which means that UBC-affiliated OSF projects are brought together on a UBC landing page. You can also use your UBC credentials to log in to this tool.
  * OSF has unlimited overall project storage but individual files and objects need to be under 5GB in size. For larger items, OSF has many integrations with storage providers.
  * OSF allows for granular management of access to parts of an objects via "Components" feature.
  * Files uploaded to OSF are hosted on Canadian servers (if that option is selected while creating a repository).
  * Collaborators do not need to be at UBC to be added to a project and different "Components" can be hosted in different places (eg. other countries).
  * Projects can be private or public.
  * [Learn more and sign up via UBC login](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/OSF)

## Task tracking and project overviews

  * [Take a look at this excellent Youtube Playlist courtesy of the folks at Asana](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJFG93oi0wJDMccrrEbbZha0v64Jo63K8)

## Chatting with your team

<hr>
[Microsoft Teams](https://it.ubc.ca/services/email-voice-internet/microsoft-teams)

<img src="images/teams-logo.png" alt="Teams logo" width="100px" height="auto">
  * Free for UBC students, faculty, and staff).
  * UBC IT offers support with Teams.
  * Integrated with Microsoft Office suite.

<hr>
[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/)

<img src="images/slack-logo.png" alt="Slack logo" width="100px" height="auto">
  * Chat tool for teams, not supported by UBC IT.
  * Commonly used in industry; useful to be aware of.
  * Free to use with limitations.
  * Hosted on US servers; not ideal for conversations about sensitive topics.

## Version control
A lot of tools have some form of built-in version control for files. Git is worth being aware of generally as a useful version control tool for text files.

Why is version control important? Learn more here:

<hr>
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)

<img src="images/git-logo.png" alt="Git logo" width="100px" height="auto">

  * Git is a version control tool that is the backbone of services like Github and GitLab.
  * It is fully open source and used widely in many different disciplines as well as in industry.
  * Git provides line by line versioning for text files, showing edits made, who made them, and when.
  * Works best with text files.

<hr>
[GitHub](https://github.com/)

<img src="images/github-logo.png" alt="GitHub logo" width="100px" height="auto">

  * Owned by Microsoft.
  * US-hosted service that uses Git as a back-end.
  * Free to use with some constraints.
  * Free web hosting through Github Pages which runs off of a Github repository.
  * Github is designed to work with text files. This means files under 100MB (works best with files under 50mb). As a result it is not for large file storage.
    * That said, Git does have provision for large file storage through <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">"git-lfs"</a>. In the context of Github this means that you can now push files <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage">up to 2GB in side with a free Github account</a>. This is not ideal for storing research data but is useful for large live files that you are working with.
    * Github has a web hosting service called Github Pages through which you can publish a simple website. Git LFS does not work with Github Pages.

<hr>
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

<img src="images/gitlab-logo.png" alt="GitLab logo" width="100px" height="auto">

  * Open Source tool for the use of Git, similar to Github.
  * GitLab is an newer service but very useful for overall workflow management.

## Storage for files you're regularly updating

<hr>
OSF (again)

<img src="images/osf-logo.png" alt="OSF logo" width="100px" height="auto">

  * Lots of integrations for file storage providers via [OSF Add-Ons](https://www.cos.io/blog/osf-add-ons-help-you-maximize-research-data-storage-and-accessibility)
  * Unlimited total storage; individual files can be up to 5GB
  * Hosting of data uploaded to a project is on Canadian servers (in Montreal) but some data about the project (eg. project metadata and information about project collaborators) is stored on US servers.

<hr>
[OneDrive](https://it.ubc.ca/services/web-servers-storage/microsoft-onedrive)

<img src="images/onedrive-logo.png" alt="OneDrive logo" width="100px" height="auto">

  * Unlimited cloud storage available for free to UBC faculty, staff, and students as part of the Microsoft suite.
  * UBC IT offers support.

<hr>
[Box](https://www.box.com)

<img src="images/box-logo.png" alt="Box logo" width="100px" height="auto">

  * Unlimited file storage and no file type limitations.
  * [Not free past 14 day trial](https://www.box.com/pricing)
  * Canadian hosting options (unlike the similar service, DropBox which is US-based)

## Note-talking
This is something we won't go deeply into but the following tools are worth exploring:

* OSF has a built-in Wiki
* Confluence is a wiki that integrates with JIRA and Trello and allows collaborative editing

Common useful structures for note-taking are the "single document" approach to all notes for a time span or project. Or one notebook per project.
