## Identifying what you need

What are your project priorities?

A lot of project and workflow management tools can be used in many different ways.

* Are visual elements important for you?
* Do you prefer lots of text?
* Is your calendar elsewhere and do you want to be able to connect it to whatever you end up using?
* How much duplication of effort (if any) is okay?

External collaborators

Are you working with students? Individuals in other countries?

Things to consider

## Your needs

Make use of a priority matrix to see what is most important to you.

## Local restrictions

No personally identifiable information on US servers.

* Are you requiring your students to use this? Disclaimer needed.

## Import and Export functions

Once your information is in a tool, can you get it out? If not, does that matter much?

## Longevity of the tool

There is nothing worse than developing a workflow, learning to rely on it, and then having it pull out from under your feet because a company has shut down.

## Local support

Does UBC support your tool? Are there other ways to get support?
